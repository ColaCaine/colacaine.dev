My "website" must be downloaded, this was intentional for it to be a repository, as it contains resources, code, local repositories, etc.
|
This is because it will be a local folder of documents, resources, etc. so it is not a traditonal "site." I still consider it as such because a lot of the main resources are
HTML and made for the web. This Github repository especially, I use as my "website" to share my files. Pretty much just Github, but I am going to call my repository what I want
because I can, and because I was recommended to use repositories for "website" anyways in the first place, plans have changed but I have a fuzzy vision.

Please review license and all readme.md's you may come across.
